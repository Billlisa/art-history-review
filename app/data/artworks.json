Southern Cape, South Africa Quartzite, natural ochres Iziko South African Museum, Cape”, with current metadata listing material as Oil on canvas, production period as 20th century (c. 1907), and place/region as Africa. This entry points to a South African Later Stone Age context of incised stone and pigment traces, often used to frame a long history of image-making in Africa rather than only later museum categories of 'tribal art.' For comparison study, it should be separated from later court or ritual objects: the emphasis here is on archaeological evidence, material traces, and early image practices.",
